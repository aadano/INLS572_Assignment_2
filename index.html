        <p>This website is intended to serve as a test/demonstration of my understanding of web development so far, even if it is rudimentary at the moment.</p>
        <p>As I progress through this course and gain a deeper understanding and mastery of web development concepts, I want to create a website about UNC Chapel Hill and why someone might consider applying to the school. Target audience may include prospecting students and their families.</p>
